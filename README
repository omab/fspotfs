Copyright (C) 2009  Matias Aguirre <matiasaguirre@gmail.com>


1. Description
    F-Spot FS implements a FUSE filesystem (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) which
    access F-Spot database to build a directory hierarchy of tag, sub-tags and
    tagged photos. This way it's easy to traverse the photo collection while
    keeping it organized in it's original format (by date, etc.).

    Images are soft links to original files.

    Write access is available, when copying/moving a file into the virtual
    filesystem, implies copying to collection directory (defined in gconf)
    and tagging properly.
